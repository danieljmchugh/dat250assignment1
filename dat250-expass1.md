# Java installation
As I have already worked a little with Java on this system, a version of the SDK has been installed. A quick `java -version` showed build version 18 is installed. The binaries are found in `urs/bin/` which is `$PATH`.

# IDE
As a personal preference, I enjoy programming with code editors rather than IDEs. Therefore I have opted to use VS Code.

# Gradle
As I am working on a MacOS laptop and have used homebrew in the past, I installed gradle version 8.3 using `brew install gradle` and verified its installation with `gradle -v`

# Git
As I am working on a MacOS laptop so git is installed with version 2.37.1

# Containers
I have gone for the recommended options of using podman. Installation of podman was also done agian through homebrew. After installtion, I tested `podman machine init` and `podman machine start` to start the VM, which gave a return message of `Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully`.
Finally the installtion was verified within using `podman info` which gave version info 4.6.1

A DockerHub account was also created, username `danieljmc`

# Exercise: Make an application production-ready

1) Created repository on github and cloned it locally.
2) Ran gradle and set up the build system according to provided settings
		Project name: dat250exp1
		Source package: no.hvl.dat250.exp1
		Target version of Java: 18
3) Ran the commands:

		./gradlew check
		./gradlew build
		./gradlew run 
Which resulted in a succesful build and the output of `Hello World!` by the generated App.java class.

# Fixing compilation errors
Without the correct package declaration in `App.java`, the compiler will throw an error of not finding the App class. Secondly adding `implementation("io.javalin:javalin:5.6.1")` into dependencies in `build.gradle.kts` includes the REST library the program uses. Next is `AppTest.java`, which has one assersion test called `appHasAGreeting`, which tests if class App has the method `getGreeting()`. A method was therefore added to `App` which returns a greeting string. Afterwhich, the program compiles.

# Quality Assurance
- Broke up method into smaller more specialized methods and removed/renamed some variables to streamline and clarify the logic, details can be seen on github.

# Package Application
A Dockerfile was created using the contents supplied by the assignment. Starting the podman Vm again, an image was build and the build system was successful after 4m12s...
Running `podman images` showed two image repositories: unit-converter and eclipse-temurin.
A repository was then created on Dockerhub and the image pushed onto it, the link being:
